GAME = {
    "name": "Clash Royale",
    "what_it_is": (
        "A real-time, one-against-one card battle. Both players deploy cards onto a shared arena at the "
        "same time; deployed troops move and fight on their own. You are one of the two players, acting "
        "through this interface: each request describes the match at this instant and asks for your next choice."
    ),
    "how_you_play": (
        "You see the match as a series of snapshots, one every `clock.seconds_between_snapshots` seconds. Each "
        "snapshot is one decision: you choose a strategy, and if it involves playing, a card and where it goes. "
        "Whatever you choose applies now, and you are asked again at the next snapshot, so anything you do not "
        "do now can still be done then. One exception: when you choose to play nothing (save_elixir or "
        "hold_elixir_for_threat), you are next asked once your elixir has gone up by one, or at once if a new "
        "enemy troop appears or one of your towers takes damage."
    ),
    "objective": (
        "Your goal is to destroy the enemy's towers — above all their king tower — before they destroy yours. "
        "Destroy more of the opponent's towers than they destroy of yours before time runs out. Each side has "
        "three towers: two princess towers and one king tower. Destroying the enemy king tower wins the match "
        "immediately. A match lasts 3 minutes; if towers destroyed are equal it goes to overtime, where the next "
        "tower destroyed wins, and if overtime also ends level the side whose weakest tower has more health wins."
    ),
    "arena": (
        "The arena is split by a river into your side (bottom) and the opponent's side (top). Two bridges cross "
        "the river, one on the left and one on the right; ground troops can only cross at a bridge, flying troops "
        "cross anywhere. Each bridge defines a lane: the left lane and the right lane. On each side, one princess "
        "tower guards each lane and the king tower stands behind them in the middle. Towers shoot enemy troops "
        "in range. A king tower does not attack until it is damaged or one of its princess towers is destroyed."
    ),
    "elixir": (
        "Elixir is the resource every card costs. You hold between 0 and 10. It refills on its own: one elixir "
        "every 2.8 seconds at the `single` rate, twice as fast at `double` (the last minute of normal time and "
        "the start of overtime) and three times as fast at `triple` (late overtime). Elixir at 10 stops "
        "refilling until some is spent: that is leaking elixir. While you sit at 10, the elixir you would have "
        "gained is lost for good, and the opponent keeps gaining theirs. The opponent has their own elixir, "
        "which is never shown."
    ),
    "elixir_and_strategy": (
        "Everything you do is paid for in elixir, so the elixir you hold right now limits what you can carry "
        "out. Playing a card costs its elixir at once. A strategy that takes several cards costs their total, "
        "spread over the time it takes to play them. Elixir spent on one thing is not available for anything "
        "else until it refills; saving elixir spends none. A card whose `elixir_cost` is more than the "
        "`elixir` you hold cannot be played until enough has refilled."

    "cards": (
        "Each player brings a deck of 8 cards. 4 are in the hand at any time and the next one to arrive is shown. "
        "Playing a card spends its elixir cost, puts it on the arena, sends it to the back of the deck order and "
        "brings the next card into the hand. A card is a troop, a building or a spell. Troops and buildings may "
        "only be placed on your own side — plus the part of the opponent's side next to a princess tower you have "
        "destroyed. A spell is cast on something of the enemy's: one of their troops, or one of their towers. "
